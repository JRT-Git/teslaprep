# Model 3 Checklist #

This is available as a [mobile app for iOS and Android](https://teslaprep.glideapp.io), too.

This pre-drive checklist is designed to be done in a specific flow to save time and make sure nothing is missed. You will essentially do several "laps" around the car. Start at the beginning and work your way down the list. By the end, your car will be fully reviewed. Feel free to print this out and bring it, along with a pen. Don't feel like you need to rush through the inspection. The delivery team at Tesla will certainly seem like they want to move quickly, but you don't need to leave the lot until you're 100% satisfied. Take your time

## SECTION 0 - Getting Started

### Quick Tips ###

- TESLA is trying to do contactless delivery for most of their vehicles when possible
- This takes away any power from you and forces you to automatically accept delivery despite the condition of the vehicle
- If possible, accept delivery at a service center
- When at the service center, they will ask for your name and inform you to scan the QR code to pay for your vehicle
- Inform them that you want to inspect the interior and exterior of the vehicle BEFORE you pay
- They may inform you it’s not possible, however tell them your friends have done it at other delivery centers and I’m not going to pay for the car without inspecting it
- The policy may have changed but ensure that you take photos and submit a service request **BEFORE 100 miles** in the TESLA app under service for any issues
- Inspection shouldn’t take more than an hour
- Download and login to the Tesla App on your phone. You will use your phone to access your Tesla on delivery day.
